# RetrofitwithRxjava
This an Example of how to use rxjava with Retrofit.
Retrofit with rxjava is an awesome combination with some topping of retrolamba.
What i have found by putting all of three together is really exceptional.
#Retrofit 
* It is fast and very easy to use.
* I can parse any many other types of responses automaticall like... #Integer, #Boolean, #String, #CustomModel
* Its callback method taht automatically handle the error, most import when key missing from json response .
#Rxjava(Best thing happened with #androdDev)
* we can have data as asynchronously.
* When i was using AsyncTask, the problem was that first i had to get complete data then parse it into Ui.Then Volly came now we can add 
data on evey count but its is running on main thread. But Rxjava with retrofit i can get data from api using seprate thread and asynchronously,
and can load data must fast then rest.
* i can acress two or more api and sync them using rxjava.
#Retrolamba
* it help mne to corde precisely , beautiful and clean.
